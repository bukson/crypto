Cracking the vigenere cipher en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen√®re_cipher.

First we try to find the length of key, then separte blocks coded with the same letter and crack it like Ceaser cipher.

Comments included in code :)

	crackvigenere.py - Doing the job

	vig.in - Example of vigenere encoded input in b64

	myEncoding.py - Contains several encoding and decoding stuff(hex, b64)

	textscore.py - Contains frequency analisys methods name Dicts(currently NormDict and NgramDict)
